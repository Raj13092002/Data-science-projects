<p>2nd project is movie recommendations project -->https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tC131vgQhC6NmvUEVrlRhBzJBV5A1lHU?usp=drive_link</p>
<p>•	by this project we have to recommend the movie on the basis of the user have seen past.</p>
<p>•	What is recommended system?</p>
<p>•	Ans- basically the system that work on the past data of user that system is called recommend system. like in Netflix a user see the comedy movie  so the Netflix see the those movies who are in the series of comedy.</p>
<p>•	Type of recommend system. </p>
<p>•	Basically there have three type of recommend system</p>
<p>1.	Content based- in this the recommend on the basis of the contents. That what type of content you used.. like if a user see the video of cricket in youtube then the YouTube recommend same type of video  or sport video. They doesn’t give the music type of video.</p>

<p>2.	Collaborate based recommend – In this type of recommendation  the recommend on the basis of the similarity of the user they recommend the videos. Like if two user see same type of film and give aprox. Rating, and their seeing of video are almost match so this recommendation system give the recommend videos. those who doesn’t see…in clear word if a see the movies so it recommend to b and b see the movies it recommend to A because their movies are almost same so by the user of the data it recommend to each other.</p>
<p>3.	Hybrid- contents + collaborate based approach.</p>
<p>•	in this we have to do the content based approach.</p>
<p>•	Approach----  Data--> pre-processing -->model bulding -->make the website   -->deploy this website.</p>
<p>•	Data set we used is tmdb_5000.</p>
